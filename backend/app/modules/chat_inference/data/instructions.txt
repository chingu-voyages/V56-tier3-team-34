Patient Management System - User Instructions

Project Description
-------------------
This is a Patient Management System designed to assist administrators in managing patient records efficiently. The system allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and searching of patient information, providing a centralized platform for healthcare data management. It also includes robust user authentication to ensure secure access to sensitive patient data.

How to Use the Web Application
------------------------------

1. Accessing the System (Authentication)
----------------------------------------
To use the Patient Management System, you must first log in with an administrator account.

Login:
1. Navigate to the application's login page (typically the main entry point or /auth/login)
2. Enter your administrator username and password in the provided fields
3. Click the "Login" or "Sign In" button
4. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the Dashboard or a similar main overview page

2. Dashboard Overview
---------------------
The Dashboard provides a summary of key information. From here, you can navigate to different sections of the application using the main menu or navigation links.

3. Patient Management
---------------------
This section allows you to manage all patient-related data. Only administrators have access to these functionalities.

Adding a New Patient:
1. From the main navigation, go to the "Patients" or "Add Patient" section
2. Click on the "Add New Patient" or similar button
3. Fill in the required patient details in the form (e.g., Name, Date of Birth, Contact Information, etc.)
4. Click "Save" or "Create Patient" to add the new record to the system

Viewing Patient Details:
1. Navigate to the "Patients" list
2. You will see a list of all registered patients
3. To view detailed information for a specific patient, click on their name or a "View Details" button next to their entry in the list

Updating Patient Information:
1. From the patient details view (or directly from the patient list, if an "Edit" option is available), click the "Edit" or "Update" button
2. Modify the necessary fields in the patient's record
3. Click "Save Changes" or "Update Patient" to apply your modifications

Searching for Patients:
1. On the "Patients" list page, locate the search bar
2. You can search for patients by various criteria such as:
   - Patient Name
   - Current Status (e.g., Admitted, Discharged, Scheduled)
   - Scheduled Date (for appointments or procedures)
   - Surgeon (if applicable)
3. Enter your search query and press Enter or click the "Search" button. The list will filter to show matching results

Viewing Patient Statistics:
1. Look for a "Statistics" or "Reports" section, possibly within the "Patients" area or on the Dashboard
2. Clicking on this will display various aggregated statistics related to patients in the system

4. Other Potential Features (Depending on Implementation)
--------------------------------------------------------
- Chat Inference: If integrated, there might be a chat interface for AI-driven interactions or insights related to patient data
- Status and Status Logs: The system may track and display various statuses for patients or internal processes, with logs available for review
- Projects/Tasks: There might be sections for managing internal projects or tasks related to patient care or administrative duties
